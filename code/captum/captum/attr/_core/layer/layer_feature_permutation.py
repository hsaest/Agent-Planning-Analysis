        Args:

            inputs (Tensor or tuple[Tensor, ...]): Input for which layer
                        attributions are computed. If forward_func takes a single
                        tensor as input, a single input tensor should be provided.
                        If forward_func takes multiple tensors as input, a tuple
                        of the input tensors should be provided. It is assumed
                        that for all given input tensors, dimension 0 corresponds
                        to the number of examples, and if multiple input tensors
                        are provided, the examples must be aligned appropriately.
            target (int, tuple, Tensor, or list, optional): Output indices for
                        which gradients are computed (for classification cases,
                        this is usually the target class).
                        If the network returns a scalar value per example,
                        no target index is necessary.
                        For general 2D outputs, targets can be either:

                        - a single integer or a tensor containing a single
                          integer, which is applied to all input examples

                        - a list of integers or a 1D tensor, with length matching
                          the number of examples in inputs (dim 0). Each integer
                          is applied as the target for the corresponding example.

                        For outputs with > 2 dimensions, targets can be either:

                        - A single tuple, which contains #output_dims - 1
                          elements. This target index is applied to all examples.

                        - A list of tuples with length equal to the number of
                          examples in inputs (dim 0), and each tuple containing
                          #output_dims - 1 elements. Each tuple is applied as the
                          target for the corresponding example.

                        Default: None
            additional_forward_args (Any, optional): If the forward function
                        requires additional arguments other than the inputs for
                        which attributions should not be computed, this argument
                        can be provided. It must be either a single additional
                        argument of a Tensor or arbitrary (non-tuple) type or a
                        tuple containing multiple additional arguments including
                        tensors or any arbitrary python types. These arguments
                        are provided to forward_func in order following the
                        arguments in inputs.
                        Note that attributions are not computed with respect
                        to these arguments.
                        Default: None
            layer_mask (Tensor or tuple[Tensor, ...], optional):
                        layer_mask defines a mask for the layer, grouping
                        elements of the layer input / output which should be
                        ablated together.
                        layer_mask should be a single tensor with dimensions
                        matching the input / output of the target layer (or
                        broadcastable to match it), based
                        on whether we are attributing to the input or output
                        of the target layer. layer_mask
                        should contain integers in the range 0 to num_groups
                        - 1, and all elements with the same value are
                        considered to be in the same group.
                        If None, then a layer mask is constructed which assigns
                        each neuron within the layer as a separate group, which
                        is ablated independently.
                        Default: None
            perturbations_per_eval (int, optional): Allows permutation of multiple
                        neuron (groups) to be processed simultaneously in one
                        call to forward_fn.
                        Each forward pass will contain a maximum of
                        perturbations_per_eval * #examples samples.
                        For DataParallel models, each batch is split among the
                        available devices, so evaluations on each available
                        device contain at most
                        (perturbations_per_eval * #examples) / num_devices
                        samples.
                        Default: 1

        Returns:
            *Tensor* or *tuple[Tensor, ...]* of **attributions**:
            - **attributions** (*Tensor* or *tuple[Tensor, ...]*):
                        Attribution of each neuron in given layer input or
                        output. Attributions will always be the same size as
                        the input or output of the given layer, depending on
                        whether we attribute to the inputs or outputs
                        of the layer which is decided by the input flag
                        `attribute_to_layer_input`
                        Attributions are returned in a tuple if
                        the layer inputs / outputs contain multiple tensors,
                        otherwise a single tensor is returned.
