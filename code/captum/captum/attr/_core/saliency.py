    A baseline approach for computing input attribution. It returns
    the gradients with respect to inputs. If `abs` is set to True, which is
    the default, the absolute value of the gradients is returned.

        Args:

            inputs (Tensor or tuple[Tensor, ...]): Input for which saliency
                        is computed. If forward_func takes a single tensor
                        as input, a single input tensor should be provided.
                        If forward_func takes multiple tensors as input, a tuple
                        of the input tensors should be provided. It is assumed
                        that for all given input tensors, dimension 0 corresponds
                        to the number of examples (aka batch size), and if
                        multiple input tensors are provided, the examples must
                        be aligned appropriately.
            target (int, tuple, Tensor, or list, optional): Output indices for
                        which gradients are computed (for classification cases,
                        this is usually the target class).
                        If the network returns a scalar value per example,
                        no target index is necessary.
                        For general 2D outputs, targets can be either:

                        - a single integer or a tensor containing a single
                          integer, which is applied to all input examples

                        - a list of integers or a 1D tensor, with length matching
                          the number of examples in inputs (dim 0). Each integer
                          is applied as the target for the corresponding example.

                        For outputs with > 2 dimensions, targets can be either:

                        - A single tuple, which contains #output_dims - 1
                          elements. This target index is applied to all examples.

                        - A list of tuples with length equal to the number of
                          examples in inputs (dim 0), and each tuple containing
                          #output_dims - 1 elements. Each tuple is applied as the
                          target for the corresponding example.

                        Default: None
            abs (bool, optional): Returns absolute value of gradients if set
                        to True, otherwise returns the (signed) gradients if
                        False.
                        Default: True
            additional_forward_args (Any, optional): If the forward function
                        requires additional arguments other than the inputs for
                        which attributions should not be computed, this argument
                        can be provided. It must be either a single additional
                        argument of a Tensor or arbitrary (non-tuple) type or a
                        tuple containing multiple additional arguments including
                        tensors or any arbitrary python types. These arguments
                        are provided to forward_func in order following the
                        arguments in inputs.
                        Note that attributions are not computed with respect
                        to these arguments.
                        Default: None

        Returns:
            *Tensor* or *tuple[Tensor, ...]* of **attributions**:
            - **attributions** (*Tensor* or *tuple[Tensor, ...]*):
                        The gradients with respect to each input feature.
                        Attributions will always be
                        the same size as the provided inputs, with each value
                        providing the attribution of the corresponding input index.
                        If a single tensor is provided as inputs, a single tensor is
                        returned. If a tuple is provided for inputs, a tuple of
                        corresponding sized tensors is returned.
