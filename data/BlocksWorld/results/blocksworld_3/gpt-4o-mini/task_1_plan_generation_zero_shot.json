(This insight does address management but should specify the necessity of clarity to move effectively.)\n\n[Add] [Insight 1]: Before unstacking or stacking a block, always check if the target block is clear and if you can perform actions; prioritizing making a block clear should come first to adhere to constraints satisfactorily.\n[Add] [Insight 2]: Action sequences must always respect the current state of the blocks, ensuring that any manipulations maintain the necessary conditions for stacking or unstacking.\n\n[Finished]",
