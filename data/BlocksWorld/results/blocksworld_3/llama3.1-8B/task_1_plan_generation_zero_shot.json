Here are the actions I can do\n\nPick up a block\nUnstack a block from on top of another block\nPut down a block\nStack a block on top of another block\n\nI have the following restrictions on my actions:\nI can only pick up or unstack one block at a time.\nI can only pick up or unstack a block if my hand is empty.\nI can only pick up a block if the block is on the table and the block is clear. A block is clear if the block has no other blocks on top of it and if the block is not picked up.\nI can only unstack a block from on top of another block if the block I am unstacking was really on top of the other block.\nI can only unstack a block from on top of another block if the block I am unstacking is clear.\nOnce I pick up or unstack a block, I am holding the block.\nI can only put down a block that I am holding.\nI can only stack a block on top of another block if I am holding the block being stacked.\nI can only stack a block on top of another block if the block onto which I am stacking the block is clear.\nOnce I put down or stack a block, my hand becomes empty.\nOnce you stack a block on top of a second block, the second block is no longer clear.\n\n[STATEMENT]\nAs initial conditions I have that, the blue block is clear, the hand is empty, the blue block is on top of the orange block, the orange block is on top of the red block and the red block is on the table.\nMy goal is to have that the blue block is on top of the red block and the orange block is on top of the blue block.\n\nWhat is the plan to achieve my goal?

State transitions are in comments in the actions definitions. An action does not change state that is not mentioned in its transition between states.  For example,  This state transition is described by the line `h2_after : 'empty'` in `\"Action 12\". The action does not effect the state that in `\"Action 5\"`. The constraint from `\"Action 12\"`  to `\"Action 15\"` requires that `space2` is equal to `'empty'` before `\"Action 12\"`.\nDo let me know if you have questions , Happy coding.\nOutput:\n```\nPick up block b Pick up block r Put down block r Stack block r on top of block o Pick up block o Stack block o on top of block b Pick up block r Put down block r Put down block o Put down block r Stack block r on top of block b \n['Action 1', 'Action 9', 'Action 14', 'Action 6', 'Action 13', 'Action 8', 'Action 3', 'Action 2', 'Action 8', 'Action 3', 'Action 2']\n{'State 15': ['  Pick up block b  ', '  Pick up block r  ', '  Put down block r  ', '  Stack block r on top of block o  ', '  Pick up block o  ', '  Stack block o on top of block b  ', '  Pick up block r  ', '  Put down block r  ', '  Put down block o  ', '  Put down block r  ', '  Stack block r on top of block b  ']}\n{'State 15': ['  Pick up block b  ', '  Pick up block r  ', '  Put down block r  ', '  Stack block r on top of block o  ', '  Pick up block o  ', '  Stack block o on top of block b  ', '  Pick up block r  ', '  Put down block r  ', '  Put down block o  ', '  Put down block r  ', '  Stack block r on top of block b  ']}\n``` \nThis plan involves actions that are labeled as `Action 1` and `Action 2` and so on. Each state in the plan are state transitions.\nNote that we stack and unstack a block in order that the block we unstack is the one we pick up. The stack in our stack and unstacking is an operation as simple as moving one block.\nNote: To make progress, unstacking (\"Put down block\") is the inverse operation of \"Stack block\" . (That the action that is applied the inverse operation  can change the order the blocks are stacked). Thus to achieve the goal I need to unstack and stack some blocks. However there is no explicit \"unstack\" operation and instead we use the inverse operation as \"Pick up block\" is the inverse operation of \"Put down a block\".\nDOCTYPE HTML \nThe plan runs in 6.7
