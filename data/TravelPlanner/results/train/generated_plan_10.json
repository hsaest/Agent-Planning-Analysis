The traveler is one person.\n[Thought]: The previous plan failed due to a repeated restaurant, a violation of the minimum nights stay rule for an accommodation, conflicting transportation, and an incorrect dinner selection. The plan should be revised to address these issues while staying within the budget.\n[Action]: Plan a 5-day trip from Greer to Philadelphia and State College, ensuring that the attractions, restaurants, and accommodations are diverse, do not violate minimum nights stay rules, and the transportation is not conflicting. Choose a correct dinner option for day 1.\n[Error]: The chosen accommodation \"\u2606 HUGE, SUNLIT Room - 3 min walk from Train !\" in State College has a minimum nights stay requirement of 29 nights, which is not met in this 5-day trip. The transportation from Philadelphia to State College on day 3 is set to a flight departing at 14:45, which conflicts with the planned lunch at Los Agaves in State College. The dinner option \"Barnes Foundation, Philadelphia\" on day 1 is not a restaurant and is therefore incorrect.\n\n[State]: The traveler's budget is set at $3,400 for a 5-day trip from Greer to two cities in Pennsylvania, visiting Philadelphia and State College.

night requirement that cannot be met within the given time frame, and do not have any house rules that conflict with the traveler's preferences or needs.\n[Support] [Insight 1]: This insight is
