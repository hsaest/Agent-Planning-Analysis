select_affordable_flight(flights, max_price)\n```python\ndef select_affordable_flight(flights: list, max_price: float) -> dict:\n    \"\"\"\n    Select the most affordable flight within the specified maximum price.\n    \n    :param flights: A list of dictionaries containing flight details.\n    :param max_price: The maximum price for the flight.\n    :return: A dictionary containing the details

minutes',\n    'FlightDate': '2022-03-17',\n    'OriginCityName': 'Orlando',\n    'DestCityName': 'Washington',\n    'Distance': 758.0\n}\n```\n\n### Step 2: Select Accommodation\nWe need to find accommodations in Orlando that meet the requirements: private rooms, within budget, and for a minimum of 2 nights.\n\n[Function]: select_accommodation(accommodations, max_price, required_rule, room_type)\n```python\ndef select_accommodation(accommodations: list, max_price: float, required_rule: str, room_type: str) -> list:\n    \"\"\"\n    Select accommodations that meet the specific requirements and are within the specified maximum price.\n    \n    :param accommodations: A list of dictionaries containing accommodation details.\n    :param max_price: The maximum price for the accommodation.\n    :param required_rule: The required rule to check (e.g., 'parties').\n    :param room_type: The type of room required (e.g., 'Entire home/apt').\n    :return: A list of accommodations that meet the specific requirements and are within the specified maximum price.\n    \"\"\"\n    return [acc for acc in accommodations if acc['price'] <= max_price and required_rule in acc['house_rules'] and acc['room type'] == room_type]\n```\n[Output]:\n```python\n[\n    {\n        'NAME': 'Private room in Jackson Heights Apartment 2+',\n        'price': 1081.0,\n        'room type': 'Private room',\n        'house_rules': 'No parties',\n        'minimum nights': 1.0,\n        'maximum occupancy': 1,\n        'review rate number': 1.0,\n        'city': 'Orlando'\n    },\n    {\n        'NAME': 'Room in Upper East Side!',\n        'price': 885.0,\n        'room type': 'Private room',\n        'house_rules': 'No smoking & No pets & No parties',\n        'minimum nights': 1.0,\n        'maximum occupancy': 2,\n        'review rate number': 4.0,\n        'city': 'Orlando'\n    }\n]\n```\n\n### Step 3: Select Meals\nWe need to select affordable meals for breakfast, lunch, and dinner each day.\n\n[Function]: select_affordable_meals(restaurants, max_price)\n```python\ndef select_affordable_meals(restaurants: list, max_price: float) -> list:\n    \"\"\"\n    Select meals that are within the specified maximum price.\n    \n    :param restaurants: A list of dictionaries containing restaurant details.\n    :param max_price: The maximum price for the meal.\n    :return: A list of restaurants that are within the specified maximum price.\n    \"\"\"\n    return [rest for rest in restaurants if rest['Average Cost'] <= max_price]\n```\n[Output]:\n```python\n[\n    {'Name': 'Hotel New Tamil Nadu', 'Average Cost': 13, 'Cuisines': 'Desserts, Italian, Fast Food, Mediterranean, Seafood', 'Aggregate Rating': 0.0, 'City': 'Orlando'},\n    {'Name': 'Fun Bytes', 'Average Cost': 13, 'Cuisines': 'Desserts, Tea, French, BBQ, Fast Food', 'Aggregate Rating': 2.5, 'City': 'Orlando'},\n    {'Name': 'Dhabha 27', 'Average Cost': 24, 'Cuisines': 'Tea, French, Mexican, Bakery, Fast Food, Seafood', 'Aggregate Rating': 3.2, 'City': 'Orlando'},\n    {'Name': 'Milan Food', 'Average Cost': 25, 'Cuisines': 'Cafe, BBQ, Seafood', 'Aggregate Rating': 0.0, 'City': 'Orlando'},\n    {'Name': 'Spice Hut', 'Average Cost': 25, 'Cuisines': 'Chinese, Cafe, Seafood', 'Aggregate Rating': 2.9, 'City': 'Orlando'}\n]\n```\n\n### Step 4: Calculate Total Cost\nWe need to ensure the total cost of transportation, accommodation, and meals stays within the budget.\n\n[Function]: calculate_total_cost(transportation_cost, accommodation_cost, meal_cost)\n```python\ndef calculate_total_cost(transportation_cost: float, accommodation_cost: float, meal_cost: float) -> float:\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the total cost of the trip, including transportation, accommodation, and meals.\n    \n    :param transportation_cost: The total cost of transportation.\n    :param accommodation_cost: The total cost of accommodation.\n    :param meal_cost: The total cost of meals.\n    :return: The total cost of the trip.\n    \"\"\"\n    return transportation_cost + accommodation_cost + meal_cost\n```\n[Output]:\n```python\n# Transportation cost: 153 (outbound) + 156 (return) = 309\n# Accommodation cost: 885 (Room in Upper East Side!) * 2 nights = 1770\n# Meal cost: 13 (breakfast) + 25 (lunch) + 25 (dinner) * 2 people * 3 days = 378\n# Total cost: 309 + 1770 + 378 = 2457\n```\n\n### Step 5: Adjust Plan to Fit Budget\nSince the total cost exceeds the budget, we need to adjust the plan. We can select a more affordable accommodation.\n\n[Function]: select_affordable_accommodations(accommodations, max_price)\n```python\ndef select_affordable_accommodations(accommodations: list, max_price: float) -> list:\n    \"\"\"\n    Select accommodations that are within the specified maximum price.\n    \n    :param accommodations: A list of dictionaries containing accommodation details.\n    :param max_price: The maximum price for the accommodation.\n    :return: A list of accommodations that are within the specified maximum price.\n    \"\"\"\n    return [acc for acc in accommodations if acc['price'] <= max_price]\n```\n[Output]:\n```python\n[\n    {\n        'NAME': 'Sixth Ave Chelsea, Studio Serviced Apartment',\n        'price': 70.0,\n        'room type': 'Entire home/apt',\n        'house_rules': 'No visitors & No pets',\n        'minimum nights': 30.0,\n        'maximum occupancy': 3,\n        'review rate number': 2.0,\n        'city': 'Orlando'\n    }\n]\n```\n\nSince the only affordable accommodation has a minimum stay of 30 nights, we need to adjust the plan further. We will select the most affordable accommodation that meets the minimum stay requirement.\n\n[Function]: select_accommodation(accommodations, max_price, required_rule, room_type)\n```python\ndef select_accommodation(accommodations: list, max_price: float, required_rule: str, room_type: str) -> list:\n    \"\"\"\n    Select accommodations that meet the specific requirements and are within the specified maximum price.\n    \n    :param accommodations: A list of dictionaries containing accommodation details.\n    :param max_price: The maximum price for the accommodation.\n    :param required_rule: The required rule to check (e.g., 'parties').\n    :param room_type: The type of room required (e.g., 'Entire home/apt').\n    :return: A list of accommodations that meet the specific requirements and are within the specified maximum price.\n    \"\"\"\n    return [acc for acc in accommodations if acc['price'] <= max_price and required_rule in acc['house_rules'] and acc['room type'] == room_type]\n```\n[Output]:\n```python\n[\n    {\n        'NAME': 'Private room in Jackson Heights Apartment 2+',\n        'price': 1081.0,\n        'room type': 'Private room',\n        'house_rules': 'No parties',\n        'minimum nights': 1.0,\n        'maximum occupancy': 1,\n        'review rate number': 1.0,\n        'city': 'Orlando'\n    }\n]\n```\n\n### Final Plan\nSince the total cost exceeds the budget, we will provide a suboptimal yet complete solution.\n\n[Plan]:\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"days\": 1,\n        \"current_city\": \"from Washington to Orlando\",\n        \"transportation\": \"Flight Number: F3755232, from Washington to Orlando, Departure Time: 06:54, Arrival Time: 09:10\",\n        \"breakfast\": \"-\",\n        \"attraction\": \"-\",\n        \"lunch\": \"-\",\n        \"dinner\": \"Hotel New Tamil Nadu, Orlando\",\n        \"accommodation\": \"Private room in Jackson Heights Apartment 2+, Orlando\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"days\": 2,\n        \"current_city\": \"Orlando\",\n        \"transportation\": \"-\",\n        \"breakfast\": \"Fun Bytes, Orlando\",\n        \"attraction\": \"SeaWorld Orlando, Orlando; The Wheel at ICON Park, Orlando; Fun Spot America Theme Parks, Orlando\",\n        \"lunch\": \"Dhabha 27, Orlando\",\n        \"dinner\": \"Milan Food, Orlando\",\n        \"accommodation\": \"Private room in Jackson Heights Apartment 2+, Orlando\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"days\": 3,\n        \"current_city\": \"from Orlando to Washington\",\n        \"transportation\": \"Flight Number: F3910463, from Orlando to Washington, Departure Time: 06:59, Arrival Time: 09:01\",\n        \"breakfast\": \"Spice Hut, Orlando\",\n        \"attraction\": \"Madame Tussauds Orlando, Orlando; Ripley's Believe It or Not!, Orlando\",\n        \"lunch\": \"Milan Food, Orlando\",\n        \"dinner\": \"-\",\n        \"accommodation\": \"-\"\n    }\n]\n```",
