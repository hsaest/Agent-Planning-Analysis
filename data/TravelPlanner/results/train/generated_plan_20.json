The accommodation selected has a maximum occupancy of 2, which is suitable for the group size.\n   \n   [Thought]: The self-driving option is cost-effective, but the long duration may lead to fatigue. The lack of meal planning on the first day is a significant oversight, as it does not align with the travelers' culinary preferences. The selected accommodation is within budget, but the itinerary lacks a structured approach to attractions and meals.\n\n   [Action]: \n   - Day 1: Start the journey early in the morning. Allocate a budget for breakfast at a fast-food restaurant on the way. Plan to arrive in Milwaukee by late evening. Dinner at \"Cool Basil\" is a good choice for Chinese cuisine. Stay at \"Affordable bedroom in the East Village!\".\n   - Day 2: Breakfast at \"Subway\" is not ideal due to its low rating. Instead, choose a better-rated restaurant. Visit the \"Milwaukee Art Museum\" and \"Discovery World\" for attractions. Lunch at \"Ramesh Vaishno Dhaba\" is acceptable, but dinner at \"The Pack King\" should be reconsidered due to its lower rating.\n   - Day 3: Breakfast at \"Doughlicious\" is fine, but lunch at \"Himalaya Food Corner\" should be evaluated for better options. Ensure to leave for the airport in time for the flight.\n\n   [Error]: The first day's meal planning is incomplete, and the choice of restaurants does not fully align with the travelers' preferences for American and Chinese cuisines. The attractions are not well-distributed across the days, leading to a potentially rushed experience.\n\n2. [State]: The budget is still a concern, and the travelers need to ensure they do not exceed $1,100. The itinerary lacks a clear structure for meals and attractions, which could lead to missed opportunities for experiences.\n\n   [Thought]: The plan needs to be more balanced in terms of meal options and attractions. The travelers should experience a variety of cuisines while also ensuring they have enough time to enjoy each attraction without feeling rushed.\n\n   [Action]: \n   - Day 1: Include a breakfast stop at a fast-food chain on the way to Milwaukee. Dinner at \"Cool Basil\" should be confirmed. \n   - Day 2: Revise breakfast to a better-rated restaurant, such as \"The Beer Cafe\". Include a visit to \"Milwaukee County Zoo\" for a more diverse attraction experience. \n   - Day 3: Ensure breakfast and lunch are at well-rated restaurants to enhance the culinary experience.\n\n   [Error]: The adjustments made still do not fully address the need for a balanced itinerary.

The total cost of the plan is $2,205, which exceeds the budget.\n\n[Thought]: The plan fails primarily due to the transportation method chosen (self-driving) and the accommodation selected, which are both too costly.

accommodations in Milwaukee that fit within our budget and meet the minimum nights stay requirement.\n\n[Function]: \n```python\ndef select_affordable_accommodations(accommodations: list, max_price: float) -> list:\n    \"\"\"\n    Select accommodations that are within the specified maximum price.\n    \n    :param accommodations: A list of dictionaries containing accommodation details.\n

accommodations for 2 nights, we will select \"Affordable bedroom in the East Village!\" which meets the minimum nights requirement.\n\n#### Step 3: Select Meals\nWe need to select affordable meals that fit within our budget and meet the cuisine preferences (American and Chinese).\n\n[Function]: \n```python\ndef select_affordable_meals(restaurants: list, max_price: float) -> list:\n    \"\"\"\n

The previous plan included self-driving from Fort Lauderdale to Milwaukee on the first day, exploring attractions in Milwaukee on the second day, and flying back to Fort Lauderdale on the third day.\n\n[Thought]: The previous plan failed due to several reasons:\n1.

It strategically chose budget-friendly attractions and dining options, such as the Milwaukee Public Museum and Madly Bangalee for dinner on the first day, to balance the budget without compromising the travel experience.\n[Thought]: The plan's success lies in its ability to prioritize cost-effective choices without sacrificing the quality of the experience. By focusing on self-driving and selecting accommodations and dining options that met the group's size and suitability requirements, it managed to stay within budget while providing a comprehensive experience of Milwaukee's attractions and cuisines.\n[Action]: The plan carefully selected attractions like the Milwaukee Public Museum and Milwaukee County Zoo, which are known for their educational value and affordability. Dining choices were made based on average cost and cuisine type, ensuring a mix of American and Chinese cuisines as requested. The accommodation choice, 'Affordable bedroom in the East Village!', was suitable for a group of 2 and had a favorable review rate, indicating good value for money.\n[Best Practice]: The key to the successful plan was the meticulous selection of cost-effective yet fulfilling activities and dining options, coupled with the strategic use of self-driving to manage transportation costs. This approach ensured that the budget was used efficiently to maximize the travel experience.\n\nFailed Plan Analysis:\n[State]: The failed plan attempted to cover a wide range of attractions and dining options but failed to adequately consider the budget constraints and the group's size, especially in terms of accommodation selection. The choice of 'Spacious 1 Bedroom in Midwood, BK!' for 2 people, with a maximum occupancy of 1, was impractical and likely led to budget overruns or unsatisfactory accommodations.\n[Thought]: The failure of this plan stemmed from overlooking the suitability and cost-effectiveness of accommodations and potentially overestimating the budget's flexibility. The selection of attractions and dining options, while diverse, may not have been optimized for cost, leading to potential budget overruns.\n[Action]: The plan included a mix of attractions and dining options but failed to ensure that all choices were suitable for a group of 2 and within the budget. The accommodation choice was inappropriate for the group size, and the use of a flight for the return journey on the third day could have been a budgetary miscalculation if not accounted for properly in the initial budget planning.\n[Error]: The accommodation selection was inappropriate for the group size, leading to potential discomfort or additional costs. The use of a flight for the return journey without clear budget allocation could have led to unforeseen expenses, jeopardizing the overall budget constraint.\n\nAction on Current Insight Set:\n[Edit] [Insight 3]: Modify the insight to emphasize the importance of selecting accommodations that not only meet the group's size and suitability requirements but also ensure that the maximum occupancy aligns with the group size to avoid additional costs or discomfort. Additionally, clarify the need to allocate budget explicitly for return transportation to prevent unforeseen expenses.\n[Support] [Insight 3]: After the edit, support the revised insight to reinforce the importance of practical and budget-conscious accommodation and transportation choices.\n[Finished]",
