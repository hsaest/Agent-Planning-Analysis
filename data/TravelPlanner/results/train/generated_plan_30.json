For example, the \"The ocean view room size 12x14\" in Portland costs $709 per night, which is quite expensive. Similarly, the \"Entire 2nd Floor with Private Bath\" in Medford costs $1,095 per night.

Firstly, the plan does not consider the minimum nights requirement for accommodations, which may lead to unnecessary costs or changes in the plan.
