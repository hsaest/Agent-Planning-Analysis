It efficiently uses flight times to maximize time in Washington, and the selection of attractions, meals, and accommodations aligns well with the group's preferences and budget.\n[Action]: The plan carefully selects flights that fit within the travel dates, schedules meals and attractions to optimize time usage, and chooses accommodations that meet the group's specific requirements.\n[Best Practice]: The key to the success of this plan lies in its meticulous budgeting, efficient time management, and careful selection of activities and accommodations that align with the group's preferences and constraints.\n\nFailed Plan Analysis:\n1.[State]: The failed plan also aimed for a 3-day trip from Bangor to Washington within the same budget and group size. However, it included an accommodation that did not allow children under 10, which conflicts with the group's requirements.\n[Thought]: The failure of this plan is attributed to a misalignment with the group's specific needs, particularly the restriction on children under 10 in the chosen accommodation.\n[Action]: The plan selected an accommodation that did not allow children under 10, which directly contradicts the group's requirements.\n[Error]: The error in this action was not verifying the suitability of the accommodation against the group's specific needs, particularly regarding children.\n\nLast Failed Plan Trajectory:\n[State]: The most recent failed plan trajectory shows a similar structure but includes an accommodation that does not allow children under 10, again contradicting the group's requirements.\n[Thought]: The failure here is again due to the accommodation choice not meeting the group's needs.\n[Action]: The plan selected an accommodation with rules against children under 10.\n[Error]: The error in this action was not ensuring the accommodation's rules aligned with the group's composition and requirements.\n\nAction on Current Insight Set:\n[Add] [Insight 1]: Ensure all selected accommodations are thoroughly vetted for compatibility with the group's specific requirements, including pet-friendliness and rules regarding children.\n[Support] [Insight 3]: (14): Modify the insight to include strict budget tracking throughout the planning process to ensure all choices are within the $1,500 budget constraint, and also consider the total budget of $1,500 for the entire trip, ensuring that the transition costs between cities are factored in, and prioritize accommodations that allow children under 10.\n[Finished]",

They require pet-friendly accommodations and prefer entire rooms to themselves. They do not plan to self-drive.\n\nThought: The plan should prioritize finding suitable flights and accommodations that meet the group's requirements.\n\nAction: The plan includes a flight from Bangor to Washington on March 21st, followed by a visit to the Seattle Aquarium, Beneath the Streets, The Gum Wall, Wings Over Washington, Discovery Park, Washington Park Arboretum, International Fountain, Pier 55, The Seattle Great Wheel, Olympic Sculpture Park, Pier 56, Kerry Park, Mount Rainier National Park, Space Needle, Olympic National Park, Sky View Observatory - Columbia Center, Smith Tower, Chihuly Garden and Glass, Chief Seattle Fountain, and Original Selfie Museum | Seattle. The group will then stay at the Beautifully Renovated 3BD/2BA \u2606 1 Block to Subway accommodation. On the second day, the group will visit more attractions and stay at the same accommodation. On the third day, the group will take a flight back to Bangor.\n\nError: The plan does not account for the group's preferences for cuisine, and the accommodations are not pet-friendly. The group size exceeds the maximum occupancy of the Beautifully Renovated 3BD/2BA \u2606 1 Block to Subway accommodation, which requires multiple rooms to accommodate everyone.\n\nAction on Current Insight Set:\n[Oppose] [Insight 1]: The itinerary should be planned with a focus on the travel plan's objectives, such as visiting attractions, trying local food, and staying within the budget. This insight should be revised to include specific details about the travel plan's objectives, such as visiting the Chazen Museum of Art in Madison and trying local cuisine in Marquette.\n[Oppose]

PLACEHOLDER\n[Oppose]   \nFailed Plan Analysis:\nState: The group of 3 people is traveling from Bangor to Washington and back, with a budget of $3,100. They require pet-friendly accommodations and prefer entire rooms to themselves. They do not plan to self-drive.\n\nThought: The plan should prioritize finding suitable flights and accommodations that meet the group's requirements.\n\nAction: The plan includes a flight from Bangor to Washington on March 21st, followed by a visit to the Seattle Aquarium, Beneath the Streets, The Gum Wall, Wings Over Washington, Discovery Park, Washington Park Arboretum, International Fountain, Pier 55, The Seattle Great Wheel, Olympic Sculpture Park, Pier 56, Kerry Park, Mount Rainier National Park, Space Needle, Olympic National Park, Sky View Observatory - Columbia Center, Smith Tower, Chihuly Garden and Glass, Chief Seattle Fountain, and Original Selfie Museum | Seattle. The group will then stay at the Beautifully Renovated 3BD/2BA \u2606 1 Block to Subway accommodation. On the second day, the group will visit more attractions and stay at the same accommodation. On the third day, the group will take a flight back to Bangor.\n\nError: The plan does not account for the group's preferences for cuisine, and the accommodations are not pet-friendly. The group size exceeds the maximum occupancy of the Beautifully Renovated 3BD/2BA \u2606 1 Block to Subway accommodation, which requires multiple rooms to accommodate everyone.\n\nAction on Current Insight Set:\n[Oppose] [Insight 1]: The itinerary should be planned with a focus on the travel plan's objectives, such as visiting attractions, trying local food, and staying within the budget. This insight should be revised to include specific details about the travel plan's objectives, such as visiting the Chazen Museum of Art in Madison and trying local cuisine in Marquette.\n[Oppose]
