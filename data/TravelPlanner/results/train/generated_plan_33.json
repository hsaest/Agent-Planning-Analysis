The choice of the 'Light-filled Apartment in great area, close 2 all!' for accommodation meets the requirement of being an entire room and conducive to hosting parties.\n[Best Practice]: The key to the success of this plan lies in its careful budgeting, strategic selection of activities and accommodations, and adherence to the preferences of avoiding flying and preferring entire rooms for accommodations.\n\nFailed Plan Analysis:\n[State]: The failed plan also aimed for a 3-day trip from Grand Forks to Minneapolis within a budget of $1,300, avoiding flying, and requiring accommodations that allow hosting parties. However, it failed to meet certain constraints or was not optimal in terms of budget management or experience diversity.\n[Thought]: The failure might be due to overspending on certain days, not fully utilizing the budget across all categories (e.g., attractions, meals, accommodations), or not selecting accommodations and activities that fully align with the preferences and constraints.\n[Action]: The plan included self-driving for transportation and selected specific attractions and restaurants, but the choice of 'ENTIRE PLACE! near Columbia-sleeps up to 8 guests!' for accommodation, while meeting the party hosting requirement, might have been costly or not optimally utilized given the group size of 2.\n[Error]: The error in this plan could be the potential overspending on accommodations that are oversized for the group size, leading to a reduction in budget available for other categories like attractions or meals. Additionally, the itinerary might not have fully optimized the experience diversity within the budget constraints.\n\nAction on Current Insight Set:\n[Edit] [Insight 3]: Modify the insight to include strict budget tracking throughout the planning process to ensure all choices are within the $1,300 budget constraint, and also consider the total budget of $1,300 for the entire trip, ensuring that the transition costs between cities are factored in, and prioritize accommodations that allow hosting parties and are cost-effective for the group size.\n[Finished]",
