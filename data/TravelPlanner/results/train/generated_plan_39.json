The transportation should not involve any flights.\n\n### Step-by-Step Plan\n\n1. **Select Accommodations**:\n   - We need to find private rooms that allow children under 10 and meet the minimum nights stay requirement.\n   - We will use the provided functions to filter the accommodations.\n\n2. **Select Restaurants**:\n   - We need to select affordable restaurants to keep the meal costs within the budget.\n\n3. **Calculate Transportation Costs**:\n   - We will use self-driving as the mode of transportation between cities.\n\n4. **Calculate Total Costs**:\n   - We will calculate the total cost of the trip, including transportation, accommodation, and meals, to ensure it stays within the budget.\n\n### Implementation\n\n#### Step 1: Select Accommodations\n\n**San Angelo Accommodations**:\n- We need to find private rooms that allow children under 10 and meet the minimum nights stay requirement.\n\n[Function]: select_accommodation(data['Accommodations in San Angelo'],

1,583 km\n- Cost: $79\n\n**Self-driving from San Angelo to Wichita Falls**:\n- Duration: 3 hours 33 mins\n- Distance: 380 km\n- Cost: $19\n\n**Self-driving from Wichita Falls to Evansville**:\n- Duration: 11 hours 45 mins\n- Distance: 1,287 km\n- Cost: $64\n\n#### Step 4: Calculate Total Costs\n\n**Accommodation Costs**:\n- San Angelo: 3 nights at $370 per night = $1,110\n- Wichita Falls: 2 nights at $702 per night = $1,404\n\n**Meal Costs**:\n- Average meal cost per day per person: $25\n- Total meal cost for 5 days for 2 people: $25 * 3 meals * 5 days * 2 people = $750\n\n**Transportation Costs**:\n- Total transportation cost: $79 + $19 + $64 = $162\n\n**Total Cost**:\n- Accommodation: $1,110 + $1,404 = $2,514\n- Meals: $750\n- Transportation: $162\n- Total: $2,514 + $750 + $162 = $3,426\n\nSince the total cost exceeds the budget, we need to adjust the accommodation or meal costs.\n\n#### Adjusted Plan\n\n**San Angelo Accommodation**:\n- Select \"New york Multi-unit building in Williamsburg BR\" at $123 per night for 3 nights = $369\n\n**Wichita Falls Accommodation**:\n- Select \"Modern Apartment on the UES\" at $702 per night for 2 nights = $1,404\n\n**Adjusted Total Cost**:\n- Accommodation: $369 + $1,404 = $1,773\n- Meals: $750\n- Transportation: $162\n- Total: $1,773 + $750 + $162 = $2,685\n\nThis adjusted plan stays within the budget.\n\n### Final Plan\n\n[Plan]:\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"days\": 1,\n        \"current_city\": \"from Evansville to San Angelo\",\n        \"transportation\": \"Self-driving, from Evansville

It also managed to stay within the budget of $2,800 by carefully selecting accommodations and dining options. The plan included a mix of attractions and allowed for sufficient time to rest and enjoy the destinations.\n[Thought]: The success of this plan can be attributed to its strategic selection of activities and accommodations that catered to the needs of a family with children under 10. The choice of private rooms in accommodations that allowed children was crucial for meeting the query's requirements. Additionally, the plan balanced travel time with activity time, ensuring a comfortable pace for the travelers.\n[Action]: The plan successfully incorporated attractions like the River Walk and the Farm and Ranch Museum in San Angelo, which are family-friendly and engaging. Dining choices were also appropriate, with options like Yumbuns and District 6 offering a variety of cuisines. The accommodation selection, such as 'Beautiful home' in San Angelo and 'Manhattan Club' in Wichita Falls, provided private rooms that met the criteria of allowing children under 10.\n[Best Practice]: The key to the success of this plan was the meticulous selection of activities and accommodations that catered to the specific needs and preferences outlined in the query. Balancing travel and activity times, along with choosing family-friendly attractions and dining options, ensured a smooth and enjoyable trip within the specified budget.\n\nFailed Plan Analysis:\n[State]: The failed plans, including the most recent one, struggled with several constraints, primarily the selection of accommodations that did not allow children under 10, which directly contradicted the query's requirements. Additionally, the dining and attraction choices, while varied, did not always align with the family-friendly theme, and the budget was not meticulously tracked, potentially leading to overspending.\n[Thought]: The failure of these plans stemmed from overlooking the critical requirement of accommodations allowing children under 10. This oversight was a fundamental error that undermined the feasibility of the entire plan. Furthermore, the lack of detailed budget tracking and the absence of a clear strategy to maximize the value of each activity and dining choice contributed to the plan's shortcomings.\n[Action]: The primary action that should have been taken was to thoroughly screen and select accommodations that explicitly permitted children under 10. Additionally, a more detailed budget analysis should have been conducted to ensure that each component of the trip, from transportation to dining, fit within the $2,800 limit. The attraction and dining choices should have been curated to ensure they were suitable for a family with children.\n[Error]: The error in the failed plans was the selection of accommodations that did not meet the query's criteria regarding children under 10. This mistake rendered the entire plan infeasible from the outset. Additionally, the lack of a detailed budget analysis and the absence of a clear strategy for selecting family-friendly activities and dining options further contributed to the plan's failure.\n\nAction on Current Insight Set:\n[Add] [Insight 1]: Ensure all selected accommodations explicitly allow children under 10 and provide private rooms to meet the query's requirements.\n[Edit] [Insight 3]: Modify the insight to include strict verification of accommodation criteria (e.g., allowing visitors, providing entire rooms) before finalizing the selection, with a specific emphasis on providing private rooms and allowing children under 10.\n[Support] [Insight 1]: Increase the emphasis on selecting family-friendly attractions and dining options that cater to the needs of travelers with children under 10.\n[Oppose] [Insight 2]: Challenge the assumption that all accommodations must provide entire rooms, as private rooms meeting the criteria of allowing children under 10 are sufficient and more budget-friendly.\n[Finished]",

Preferred accommodations are private rooms that permit children under 10.\n[Thought]: The failed plan primarily failed due to budget overruns, incorrect room type selection, and house rules not permitting children under 10. The transportation and attraction selection were appropriate, but the cost of accommodations and meals exceeded the budget significantly.\n[Action]: Refine the plan by selecting more budget-friendly accommodations and meals, ensuring they meet the criteria of private rooms permitting children under 10. Adjust the itinerary to include more cost-efficient options without compromising the experience.\n[Error]: The primary errors were the selection of accommodations and meals that did not fit within the budget and did not meet the criteria of permitting children under 10. The room type was also incorrect, as it did not specify private rooms.\n\nAction on Current Insight Set:\n[Add] [Insight 37]: Prioritize accommodations that offer private rooms, allow children under 10, and are within the budget to meet the group's requirements and avoid budget overruns.\n[Edit] [Insight 1]: Correct the minimum nights stay requirement for accommodations and ensure the total cost fits within the budget, considering the group size of 3. (Revise to consider the group size of 2 adults and children under 10.)\n[Support] [Insight 4]: Regularly review and adjust the travel plan to ensure it aligns with the budget constraints and provided data, focusing on high-cost areas such as accommodations and meals. (Include a step to reduce the cost of accommodations and meals to fit within the budget.)\n[Oppose] [Insight 20]: Revise to ensure accommodations selected are entire homes/apartments and can accommodate a group of 5 people within the budget. (This insight is incorrect as it does not consider the need for private rooms and the specific group size of 2 adults and children under 10.)\n[Finished]",
