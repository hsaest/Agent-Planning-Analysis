Cost: $358 + $45 + $48 + $702 = $1,153\n\n#### Accommodation Cost\n- Dallas: $609 (Take it now you won't find better) * 2 nights = $1,218\n- Houston: $746 (Superhost 3 bedroom DISCOUNT) * 1 night = $746\n- San Antonio: $642 (Private House in Trendy Crown Heights) * 4 nights = $2,568\n\nTotal Accommodation Cost: $1,218 + $746 + $2,568 = $4,532\n\n#### Meal Cost\n- Dallas: Average $50 per meal * 3 meals * 2 days * 4 people = $1,200\n- Houston: Average $50 per meal * 3 meals * 1 day * 4 people = $600\n- San Antonio: Average $50 per meal * 3 meals * 4 days * 4 people = $2,400\n\nTotal Meal Cost: $1,200 + $600 + $2,400 = $4,200\n\n#### Total Trip Cost\n[Function]: calculate_total_cost(transportation_cost, accommodation_cost, meal_cost)\n```python\ndef calculate_total_cost(transportation_cost,

The accommodations selected did not always allow parties, and some meals exceeded the average cost per person, potentially straining the budget. The plan also did not consider the time required for travel and attraction visits, which could lead to scheduling conflicts.\n\n[Action]: Refine the itinerary to include more realistic daily schedules, ensuring that each day includes sufficient time for travel, attractions, and meals.
