The itinerary included a variety of attractions and dining options that catered to the group's culinary interests in Chinese, French, American, and Indian cuisines.\n[Thought]: The successful plan demonstrated careful consideration of the group's preferences and constraints, including budget, accommodation type, and culinary interests. The selection of attractions and restaurants was well-balanced, providing a mix of experiences while ensuring that the group could enjoy their meals without exceeding their budget.\n[Action]: The plan included a structured itinerary with specific details for each day, including transportation, meals, attractions, and accommodations. This organization helped ensure that all aspects of the trip were accounted for and that the group could enjoy their time without unnecessary stress.\n\nBest Practice:\n1.

We will also ensure that the accommodations meet the minimum nights stay requirement and that the selected restaurants offer Chinese, French, American, and Indian cuisines.\n\n### Step-by-Step Plan\n\n1. **Transportation**: Since no flights are allowed, we will use self-driving for all inter-city travel.\n2. **Accommodation**: We need entire rooms for ourselves, and the accommodation must meet the minimum nights stay requirement.\n3. **Meals**: We will select restaurants offering the specified cuisines and ensure the total meal cost stays within the budget.\n\n### Step 1: Select
