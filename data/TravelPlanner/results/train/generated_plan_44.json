The cities to be visited are Abilene, Amarillo, and Lubbock. We will avoid flights and use self-driving as the mode of transportation. We will also ensure that the accommodations are entire rooms and meet the minimum nights stay requirement. The meals will include a variety of cuisines such as American, Chinese, Mexican, and French.\n\n### Step-by-Step Plan\n\n1. **Transportation Costs Calculation**\n   - Self-driving from Moline to

Transportation is limited to self-driving and taxis due to the avoidance of flights.\n\n[Thought]: The failed plans indicate a lack of consideration for the long driving durations and their impact on the daily schedule and fatigue levels.

Additionally, the choice of restaurants and attractions should be more diverse to cater to the preferred cuisines and interests.\n\n[Action]: \n1.

Additionally, the selection of accommodations did not always ensure entire rooms, and the budget was not strictly adhered to.\n[Thought]: The over-reliance on Subway for breakfast across multiple days indicates a lack of diversity in dining options, which contradicts the travelers' preference for a variety of cuisines.
