need to recalculate the total cost of the trip with the adjusted accommodations and meals.\n\n[Function]: calculate_total_cost(transportation_cost, accommodation_cost, meal_cost)\n- Parameters: transportation_cost = 0 (initially), accommodation_cost = (614 * 3) + (565 * 2) + (226 * 2), meal_cost = (32 + 24 + 17 + 47 + 31 + 34) * 2\n\n[Output]: 614*3 + 565*2 + 226*2 = 1842 + 1130 + 452 = 3424\n- Meal cost: (32 + 24 + 17 + 47 + 31 + 34) * 2 = 185 * 2 = 370\n- Total cost: 3424 + 370 = 3794\n\n#### Step 9: Check Total Cost Against Budget\nWe need to ensure that the total cost of the trip stays within the budget.\n\n[Function]: check_budget(total_cost, budget)\n- Parameters: total_cost = 3794, budget = 5100\n\n[Output]: True\n\n### Final Plan\n[Plan]:\n```json\n[\n    {\n

budget.\n\n**Transportation Costs:**\n- Self-driving from Minneapolis to Toledo: $52\n- Self-driving from Toledo to Cleveland: $9\n- Self-driving from Cleveland to Dayton: $17\n- Self-driving from Dayton to Minneapolis: $56\n\nTotal transportation cost: $52 + $9 + $17 + $56 = $134\n\n**Accommodation Costs:**\n- Toledo: 'Sunny Modern Lux Private House with Parking' for 3 nights at $614/night = $614 * 3 = $1,842\n- Cleveland: 'Richmond Hill 3 Bedroom apartment in Private home!' for 2 nights at $565/night = $565 * 2 = $1,130\n- Dayton: 'Studio apartment; close to tourist attractions' for 2 nights at $769/night = $769 * 2 = $1,538\n\nTotal accommodation cost: $1,842 + $1,130 + $1,538 = $4,510\n\n**Meal Costs:**\nAssuming 3 meals per day for 2 people, we need 42 meals in total. We will select a variety of restaurants to avoid repetition and fit within the budget.\n\n[Function]: select_affordable_meals(restaurants=data['Restaurants in Toledo'], max_price=100)\n[Output]:
