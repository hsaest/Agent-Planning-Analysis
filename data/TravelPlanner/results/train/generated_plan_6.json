The accommodations selected were too expensive, and some meals were not budget-friendly.\n[Thought]: The plan did not adequately consider the overall budget when selecting accommodations and dining options. Additionally, the attractions chosen for certain days were too numerous, leading to potential time constraints.\n[Action]: The plan included flights and attractions but failed to balance the costs effectively. The choice of restaurants was not aligned with the budget, and the accommodation was too high-priced for a single traveler.\n\nError: The accommodation \"Spacious, bright room, prime Williamsburg location\" was too expensive at $900 per night, which significantly impacted the overall budget for the trip.\n\nError: The breakfast option \"Burger Queen Drive In\" was not a suitable choice as it did not provide a healthy start to the day and was also relatively expensive.\n\nError: The selection of attractions on Day 2 was excessive, leading to potential time constraints and a rushed experience.\n\nError: The choice of \"Minerva's Food & Cocktails\" for dinner was not budget-friendly, as it was one of the more expensive options.\n\nError: The final day lacked a structured plan for meals and attractions, which could lead to a disorganized end to the trip.\n\nAction on Current Insight Set:\n[Oppose] [Insight 2]: Always include breakfast options in travel plans to ensure a complete itinerary and a good start to each day. (While breakfast is important, it should be flexible based on budget and personal preferences.)\n[Edit] [Insight 2]: Include breakfast options in travel plans when feasible, ensuring a good start to each day while considering budget constraints.\n\n[Finished]",
