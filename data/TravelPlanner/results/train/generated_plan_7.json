The previous plan included self-driving for transportation, visits to attractions, and meals at specified restaurants. The accommodations were chosen based on the provided data.\n\n[Thought]: The previous plan failed due to several reasons:\n1. The self-driving duration from Santa Ana to Helena is excessively long (16 hours 39 mins), making it impractical for a single day.\n2. The plan does not account for the fatigue and need for rest after such a long drive, which could compromise safety and the enjoyment of the trip.\n3. The budget allocation for transportation (self-driving) seems underestimated, especially considering the long distances and potential costs of overnight stays if split into multiple days.\n4. The plan does not provide flexibility for unforeseen circumstances or changes in weather conditions that could affect travel times and safety.\n\n[Action]: To address these issues, the plan should be revised to include:\n1. A more realistic approach to travel, possibly considering flights or splitting the self-driving into multiple days with overnight stays.\n2. Incorporating rest days or breaks during long travel periods to ensure safety and reduce fatigue.\n3. Revising the budget allocation to better reflect the costs of travel, including potential overnight stays and meals during long drives.\n4. Adding contingency plans for weather and other unforeseen circumstances.\n\n[Error]: The previous plan's error lies in the unrealistic expectation of completing a 16-hour drive in a single day without accounting for rest, safety, and potential additional costs.

It also balances the selection of attractions, meals, and accommodations to ensure a diverse and enjoyable experience within the budget constraints.\n[Action]: The plan carefully selects attractions like ExplorationWorks and Spring Meadow Lake State Park in Helena, and Western Heritage Center and Pictograph Cave State Park in Billings. Meals are chosen based on variety and cost-effectiveness, such as Brijwasi Chat Bhandar and Being Truckers in Helena, and Holy Smoke and Tsui Wong in Billings.

However, it includes some choices that may not align with the traveler's preferences or may not be the most cost-effective.\n[Thought]: The failure might stem from the selection of some expensive meals and accommodations that could lead to budget overruns. Additionally, the plan does not fully optimize the use of self-driving for transportation, which is a cost-effective option.\n[Action]: The plan includes meals like TT Burger and Palmshore in Helena, which are relatively expensive compared to others in the area. The accommodation choice, Entire One bedroom Apartment in Midtown Manhattan, Helena, is also costly and may not be necessary for a solo traveler. The attractions selected are diverse but do not consider potential overlaps in themes or visitor preferences.\n[Error]: The selection of expensive meals and accommodations in the failed plan could lead to budget overruns, which is a critical error given the specified budget constraints.
