to ensure it stays within the budget.\n\n#### Transportation Costs\n- Provo to San Diego: $56\n- San Diego to Santa Ana: $7\n- Santa Ana to Bakersfield: $11\n- Bakersfield to Provo: $53\n- Total Transportation Cost: $127\n\n#### Accommodation Costs\n- San Diego: 3 nights at $392/night = $1,176\n- Santa Ana: 2 nights at $522/night = $1,044\n- Bakersfield: 2 nights at $992/night = $1,984\n- Total Accommodation Cost: $4,204\n\n#### Meal Costs\nAssuming 3 meals per day per person, we will calculate the average cost of meals for the group.\n\n- San Diego: Average meal cost = $33 (Open Yard)\n- Santa Ana: Average meal cost = $12 (The Bee's Knees)\n- Bakersfield: Average meal cost = $12 (DePalma's Italian Cafe - East Side)\n- Total Meal Cost: 7 days * 3 meals/day * 5 people * $19 (average) = $1,995\n\n#### Total Cost\n- Total Cost = Transportation Cost + Accommodation Cost + Meal Cost\n- Total Cost = $127 + $4,204 + $1,995 = $6,326\n\n### Step 5: Plan Attractions\nWe will include popular attractions in each city.\n\n#### San Diego\n- Cabrillo National Monument\n- La Jolla Shores Park\n- California Tower\n\n#### Santa Ana\n- Bowers Museum\n- Santa Ana Zoo\n- Heritage Museum of Orange County\n\n#### Bakersfield\n- Buena Vista Museum of Natural History & Science\n- Kern County Museum\n- Bakersfield Museum of Art\n\n### Final Plan\n[Plan]:\n[\n{\n\"days\":
