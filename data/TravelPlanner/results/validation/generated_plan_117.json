Let's break down the plan step-by-step.\n\n### Step 1: Transportation from Rockford to Gainesville\nSince there is no flight available from Rockford to Gainesville on March 8th, we will consider self-driving.\n\n[Function]: \n```python\ndef calculate_transportation_cost(distance: float, cost_per_km: float, num_cars: int) -> float:\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the total transportation cost for self-driving.\n    \n    :param distance: The distance to be traveled in kilometers.\n    :param cost_per_km: The cost per kilometer.\n    :param num_cars: The number of cars required.\n    :return: The total transportation cost.\n    \"\"\"\n    return distance * cost_per_km * num_cars\n```\n\n[Function]: calculate_transportation_cost(1822, 0.05, 2)  # 2 cars needed for 8 people\n\n[Output]: 182.2\n\n### Step 2: Accommodation in Gainesville\nWe need to find accommodations that can host 8 people and meet the minimum nights stay requirement.\n\n[Function]: select_accommodation(data['Accommodations in Gainesville'], 1000, 'No parties', 'Entire home/apt')\n\n[Output]: \n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"NAME\": \"Suite Nest /free street parking+wifi\",\n        \"price\": 1171.0,\n        \"room type\": \"Entire home/apt\",\n        \"house_rules\": \"No smoking & No parties\",\n        \"minimum nights\": 30.0,\n        \"maximum occupancy\": 8,\n        \"review rate number\": 2.0,\n        \"city\": \"Gainesville\"\n    }\n]\n```\n\nSince the minimum nights requirement is 30, this accommodation is not suitable. We need to find another option.\n\n[Function]: select_accommodation(data['Accommodations in Gainesville'], 1000, 'No visitors', 'Entire home/apt')\n\n[Output]: \n```json\n[]\n```\n\nNo suitable accommodations found for the entire group in Gainesville.
