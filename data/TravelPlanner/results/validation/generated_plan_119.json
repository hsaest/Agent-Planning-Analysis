within Illinois from March 13th to March 19th, 2022, with a budget of $8,400, we will follow these steps:\n\n1. **Select Accommodations**: Ensure accommodations are within the provided data, allow children under 10, and meet the minimum nights stay requirement.\n2. **Plan Transportation**: Use self-driving or taxi options as flights are not available for some routes.\n3. **Select Meals**: Choose affordable restaurants to stay within the budget.\n4. **Calculate Total Cost**: Ensure the total cost of accommodation, meals, and transportation stays within the budget.\n\n### Step 1: Select Accommodations\nWe need to find accommodations in Moline, Chicago, and Rockford that allow children under 10 and meet the minimum nights stay requirement.\n\n#### Moline\n[Function]: select_accommodation(data['Accommodations in Moline'], 1000, 'No children under 10', 'Entire home/apt')\n[Output]: []\n\nSince no accommodations in Moline meet the criteria, we will select the next
