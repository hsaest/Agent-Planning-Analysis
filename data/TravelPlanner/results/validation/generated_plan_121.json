plan a 3-day trip for a group of 3 from Asheville to Minneapolis from March 7th to March 9th, 2022, with a budget of $2,300, we need to consider transportation, accommodation, meals, and attractions. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Transportation**: Since there are no flights available, we will consider self-driving.\n2. **Accommodation**: We need to find accommodations that allow pets and provide entire rooms.\n3. **Meals**: We will select restaurants that offer a variety of cuisines, including Indian, Chinese, Mediterranean, and American.\n4. **Attractions**: We will include popular attractions in Minneapolis.\n\n### Step-by-Step Plan\n\n#### Step 1: Transportation\nSince there are no flights available, we will use self-driving for transportation.\n\n[Function]: \n```python\ndef get_transportation_cost(transportation: dict) -> float:\n    \"\"\"\n    Get the cost of the transportation.\n    \n    :param transportation: A dictionary containing transportation details.\n    :return: The cost of the transportation.\n    \"\"\"\n    return transportation['cost']\n```\n\n[Output]:\n```python\ntransportation_cost = 85  # Self-driving cost from Asheville to Minneapolis\n```\n\n#### Step 2: Accommodation\nWe need to find accommodations that allow pets, provide entire rooms, and meet the minimum nights stay requirement.\n\n[Function]: \n```python\ndef select_accommodation(accommodations: list, max_price: float, required_rule: str, room_type: str) -> list:\n    \"\"\"\n    Select accommodations that meet the specific requirements and are within the specified maximum price.\n    \n    :param accommodations: A list of dictionaries containing accommodation details.\n    :param max_price: The maximum price for the accommodation.\n    :param required_rule: The required rule to check (e.g., 'parties').\n    :param room_type: The type of room required (e.g., 'Entire home/apt').\n    :return: A list of accommodations that meet the specific requirements and are within the specified maximum price.\n    \"\"\"\n    return [acc for acc in accommodations if acc['price'] <= max_price and required_rule in acc['house_rules'] and acc['room type'] == room_type]\n```\n\n[Output]:\n```python\naccommodations = [\n    {'NAME': 'Light-filled Apartment in great area, close 2 all!', 'price': 343.0, 'room type': 'Entire home/apt', 'house_rules': 'No visitors', 'minimum nights': 1.0, 'maximum occupancy': 2, 'review rate number': 5.0, 'city': 'Minneapolis'},\n    {'NAME': 'ENTIRE PLACE! near Columbia-sleeps up to 8 guests!', 'price': 663.0, 'room type': 'Entire home/apt', 'house_rules': 'No visitors', 'minimum nights': 1.0, 'maximum occupancy': 6, 'review rate number': 5.0, 'city': 'Minneapolis'}\n]\n```\n\n#### Step 3: Meals\nWe will select restaurants that offer a variety of cuisines and are affordable.\n\n[Function]: \n```python\ndef select_affordable_meals(restaurants: list, max_price: float) -> list:\n    \"\"\"\n    Select meals that are within the specified maximum price.\n    \n    :param restaurants: A list of dictionaries containing restaurant details.\n    :param max_price: The maximum price for the meal.\n    :return: A list of restaurants that are within the specified maximum price.\n    \"\"\"\n    return [rest for rest in restaurants if rest['Average Cost'] <= max_price]\n```\n\n[Output]:\n```python\nrestaurants = [\n    {'Name': 'The Cafe', 'Average Cost': 14, 'Cuisines': 'Indian, Mediterranean, Desserts, Seafood', 'Aggregate Rating': 4.9, 'City': 'Minneapolis'},\n    {'Name': 'Court Avenue Brewing Company', 'Average Cost': 31, 'Cuisines': 'Pizza, French, Bakery, BBQ, Seafood', 'Aggregate Rating': 4.2, 'City': 'Minneapolis'},\n    {'Name': 'Texas Roadhouse', 'Average Cost': 22, 'Cuisines': 'Cafe, Pizza, BBQ, Desserts', 'Aggregate Rating': 3.5, 'City': 'Minneapolis'},\n    {'Name': 'Monkeypod Kitchen by Merriman', 'Average Cost': 50, 'Cuisines': 'Desserts, Pizza, Bakery, Fast Food, Indian, Mediterranean', 'Aggregate Rating': 4.2, 'City': 'Minneapolis'}\n]\n```\n\n#### Step 4: Attractions\nWe will include popular attractions in Minneapolis.\n\n[Output]:\n```python\nattractions = [\n    {'Name': 'Minneapolis Sculpture Garden', 'City': 'Minneapolis'},\n    {'Name': 'Minneapolis Institute of Art', 'City': 'Minneapolis'},\n    {'Name': 'Mill City Museum', 'City': 'Minneapolis'},\n    {'Name': 'Mill Ruins Park', 'City': 'Minneapolis'},\n    {'Name': 'Weisman Art Museum', 'City': 'Minneapolis'}\n]\n```\n\n#### Step 5: Calculate Total Cost\nWe need to ensure the total cost of the trip stays within the budget.\n\n[Function]: \n```python\ndef calculate_total_cost(transportation_cost: float, accommodation_cost: float, meal_cost: float) -> float:\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the total cost of the trip, including transportation, accommodation, and meals.\n    \n    :param transportation_cost: The total cost of transportation.\n    :param accommodation_cost: The total cost of accommodation.\n    :param meal_cost: The total cost of meals.\n    :return: The total cost of the trip.\n    \"\"\"\n    return transportation_cost + accommodation_cost + meal_cost\n```\n\n[Output]:\n```python\n# Accommodation cost for 2 nights\naccommodation_cost = 663 * 2  # ENTIRE PLACE! near Columbia-sleeps up to 8 guests!\n\n# Meal cost for 3 days (3 meals per day)\nmeal_cost = (14 + 31 + 22) * 3  # Average cost of selected restaurants\n\n# Total cost\ntotal_cost = calculate_total_cost(85, accommodation_cost, meal_cost)\n```\n\n[Output]:\n```python\ntotal_cost = 85 + (663 * 2) + ((14 + 31 + 22) * 3) = 85 + 1326 + 201 = 1612\n```\n\nThe total cost of $1,612 is within the budget of $2,300.\n\n### Final
