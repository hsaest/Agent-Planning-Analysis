We will avoid flights and ensure the accommodation allows pets. Let's start by selecting suitable accommodations and then plan the rest of the trip.\n\n### Step 1: Select Accommodations\nWe need to find accommodations that allow pets, are within our budget, and meet the minimum nights stay requirement.\n\n[Function]: select_accommodation(accommodations, max_price=1000, required_rule='No pets', room_type='Entire home/apt')\n\n[Output]:\n```python\n[\n    {\n        'NAME': 'True 2 bedroom apartment in the heart of the LES',\n        'price': 1094.0,\n        'room type': 'Entire home/apt',\n        'house_rules': 'No pets & No parties',\n        'minimum nights': 2.0,\n        'maximum occupancy': 10,\n        'review rate number': 1.0,\n        'city': 'Portland'\n    }\n]\n```\n\nThe selected accommodation is over budget.
