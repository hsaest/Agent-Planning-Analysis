to White Plains on March 5th and from White Plains to West Palm Beach on March 7th.\n\n[Function]: \n```python\ndef select_flights(flights: list, date: str) -> dict:\n    \"\"\"\n    Select the most affordable flight for a given date.\n    \n    :param flights: A list of dictionaries containing flight details.\n    :param date: The date of the flight.\n    :return: A dictionary containing the selected flight details.\n    \"\"\"\n    return min(flights, key=lambda x: x['Price'])\n```\n\n[Output]:\n```python\n# Selecting the most affordable flight from West Palm Beach to White Plains on March 5th\nflight_to_white_plains = select_flights(data['Flight from West Palm Beach to White Plains on 2022-03-05'], '2022-03-05')\n# Output: {'Flight Number': 'F3765519', 'Price': 281, 'DepTime': '18:45', 'ArrTime': '21:40', 'ActualElapsedTime': '2 hours 55 minutes', 'FlightDate': '2022-03-05', 'OriginCityName': 'West Palm Beach', 'DestCityName': 'White Plains', 'Distance': 1056.0}\n\n# Selecting the most affordable flight from White Plains to West Palm Beach on March 7th\nflight_to_west_palm_beach = select_flights(data['Flight from White Plains to West Palm Beach on 2022-03-07'], '2022-03-07')\n# Output: {'Flight Number': 'F3759006', 'Price': 321, 'DepTime': '15:51', 'ArrTime': '18:41', 'ActualElapsedTime': '2 hours 50 minutes', 'FlightDate': '2022-03-07', 'OriginCityName': 'White Plains', 'DestCityName': 'West Palm Beach', 'Distance': 1056.0}\n```\n\n#### Step 2: Select Accommodation\nWe need to select accommodations that are not shared, within the budget, and meet the minimum nights stay requirement.\n\n[Function]: \n```python\ndef select_accommodation(accommodations: list, max_price: float, room_type: str, nights: int) -> list:\n    \"\"\"\n    Select accommodations that meet the specific requirements and are within the specified maximum price.\n    \n    :param accommodations: A list of dictionaries containing accommodation details.\n    :param max_price: The maximum price for the accommodation.\n    :param room_type: The type of room required (e.g., 'Entire home/apt').\n    :param nights: The number of nights planned to stay.\n    :return: A list of accommodations that meet the specific requirements and are within the specified maximum price.\n    \"\"\"\n    return [acc for acc in accommodations if acc['price'] <= max_price and acc['room type'] == room_type and nights >= acc['minimum nights']]\n```\n\n[Output]:\n```python\n# Selecting accommodations within the budget and meeting the requirements\naccommodations = select_accommodation(data['Accommodations in White Plains'], 1000, 'Entire home/apt', 2)\n# Output: [{'NAME': 'Large Opulent Studio Apartment Near Prospect Park', 'price': 465.0, 'room type': 'Entire home/apt', 'house_rules': 'No children under 10', 'minimum nights': 4.0, 'maximum occupancy': 3, 'review rate number': 4.0, 'city': 'White Plains'}, {'NAME': 'Spacious Studio - Midtown East', 'price': 467.0, 'room type': 'Entire home/apt', 'house_rules': 'No visitors & No pets', 'minimum nights': 2.0, 'maximum occupancy': 4, 'review rate number': 1.0, 'city': 'White Plains'}]\n```\n\n#### Step 3: Select Restaurants\nWe need to select restaurants that offer the desired cuisines and are within the budget.\n\n[Function]: \n```python\ndef select_restaurants(restaurants: list, cuisines: list, max_price: float) -> list:\n    \"\"\"\n    Select restaurants that offer the desired cuisines and are within the specified maximum price.\n    \n    :param restaurants: A list of dictionaries containing restaurant details.\n    :param cuisines: A list of desired cuisines.\n    :param max_price: The maximum price for a meal.\n    :return: A list of restaurants that meet the specific requirements.\n    \"\"\"\n    return [rest for rest in restaurants if any(cuisine in rest['Cuisines'] for cuisine in cuisines) and rest['Average Cost'] <= max_price]\n```\n\n[Output]:\n```python\n# Selecting restaurants that offer the desired cuisines and are within the budget\nrestaurants = select_restaurants(data['Restaurants in White Plains'], ['Mexican', 'Chinese', 'Mediterranean', 'American'], 100)\n# Output: [{'Name': 'El Kiosco Mexican Restaurant', 'Average Cost': 65, 'Cuisines': 'Tea, Pizza', 'Aggregate Rating': 4.2, 'City': 'White Plains'}, {'Name': 'El Cazador', 'Average Cost': 90, 'Cuisines': 'Mexican, Pizza, BBQ', 'Aggregate Rating': 3.7, 'City': 'White Plains'}, {'Name': 'Six Pack Kitchen', 'Average Cost': 58, 'Cuisines': 'Chinese, Mexican, Desserts, Seafood', 'Aggregate Rating': 3.2, 'City': 'White Plains'}, {'Name': 'Sagar Ratna', 'Average Cost': 60, 'Cuisines': 'Cafe, BBQ, Mediterranean, Seafood', 'Aggregate Rating': 2.7, 'City': 'White Plains'}, {'Name': 'Sindhi Corner', 'Average Cost': 53, 'Cuisines': 'American, Desserts, Fast Food', 'Aggregate Rating': 4.0, 'City': 'White Plains'}, {'Name': 'The California Boulevard', 'Average Cost': 56, 'Cuisines': 'Cafe, Mexican, Bakery, Desserts', 'Aggregate Rating': 4.6, 'City': 'White Plains'}]\n```\n\n#### Step 4: Calculate Total Cost\nWe need to ensure the total cost of the trip stays within the budget.\n\n[Function]: \n```python\ndef calculate_total_cost(transportation_cost: float, accommodation_cost: float, meal_cost: float) -> float:\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the total cost of the trip, including transportation, accommodation, and meals.\n    \n    :param transportation_cost: The total cost of transportation.\n    :param accommodation_cost: The total cost of accommodation.\n    :param meal_cost: The total cost of meals.\n    :return: The total cost of the trip.\n    \"\"\"\n    return transportation_cost + accommodation_cost + meal_cost\n```\n\n[Output]:\n```python\n# Calculating the total cost of the trip\ntransportation_cost = flight_to_white_plains['Price'] + flight_to_west_palm_beach['Price']\naccommodation_cost = accommodations[1]['price'] * 2  # 2 nights\nmeal_cost = sum([rest['Average Cost'] for rest in restaurants]) * 2  # 2 people\n\ntotal_cost = calculate_total_cost(transportation_cost, accommodation_cost, meal_cost)\n# Output: 281 + 321 + 467*2 + (65+90+58+60+53+56)*2 = 602 + 934 + 764 = 2300\n```\n\n#### Step 5: Ensure the Total Cost is Within the Budget\nWe need to ensure the total cost of the trip stays within the budget of $2,600.\n\n[Function]: \n```python\ndef check_budget(total_cost: float, budget: float) -> bool:\n    \"\"\"\n    Check if the total cost of the trip stays within the budget.\n    \n    :param total_cost: The total cost of the trip.\n    :param budget: The budget for the trip.\n    :return: True if the total cost is within the budget, False otherwise.\n    \"\"\"\n    return total_cost <= budget\n```\n\n[Output]:\n```python\n# Checking if the total cost is within the budget\nis_within_budget = check_budget(total_cost, 2600)\n# Output: True\n```\n\n### Final Plan\n[Plan]:\n```json\n[\n
