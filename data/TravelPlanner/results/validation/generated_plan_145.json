Given that you're traveling from Milwaukee and visiting 2 cities in Michigan, I've chosen a route that maximizes your time in Michigan while keeping transportation costs in mind. We'll be focusing on Alpena and Kalamazoo.\n\nDay 1: Milwaukee (March 21st, 2022)\n\n- Transportation to Alpena: Since there are no flights available, we'll opt for self-driving from Milwaukee to Alpena. This will take 7 hours and 37 minutes, covering a distance of 749 kilometers. The estimated cost for self-driving is $37.\n- Accommodation in Alpena: I've found a private room available, which aligns with your requirement. The 5-bedroom won't be ideal given the cost but serves as an alternative for a private room within the price limit.\n- Lunch and Dinner: We can choose a nearby cafe for lunch and A & A Pagliai's Pizza for dinner.\n\nBreakfast on Days 2-5 will be  grabbed from a local eatery like Flying Mango, for example. This will ensure a quick breakfast to save time.\n\nDay 2: Alpena (March 22nd, 2022)\n\n- Breakfast: Grab a quick breakfast at a local cafe.\n- Attraction: Explore Mich-e-ke-wis Park, a beautiful park with walking trails and opportunities to spot wildlife.\n- Lunch: Head to Maplai for some delicious Indian cuisine.\n- Dinner: Enjoy a meal at Zaffran - The Bristol Hotel.\n\nDay 3: Alpena to Kalamazoo, Michigan\n\n- Transportation: We'll self-drive from Alpena to Kalamazoo, covering a distance of 464 kilometers and taking approximately 4 hours and 33 minutes. The estimated cost for self-driving is $23.\n- Breakfast: Grab a quick breakfast at a local eatery.\n- Attraction: Visit the Kalamazoo Nature Center, a beautiful nature preserve with walking trails and picnic areas.\n- Lunch: Enjoy a meal at Django, serving Mediterranean cuisine.\n- Dinner: Have dinner at Pandit Ved Prakash Lemon Wale, offering a mix of pizza and Indian flavors.\n\nDay 4: Kalamazoo\n\n- Breakfast: Grab a quick breakfast at a local eatery.\n- Attraction: Explore Kalamazoo Institute of Arts, a museum featuring a diverse collection of art.\n- Lunch: Enjoy a meal at Taco Bell.\n- Dinner: Have dinner at Oxy Lounge, offering a variety of desserts.\n\nDay 5: Kalamazoo to Milwaukee\n\n- Transportation: We'll self-drive from Kalamazoo to Milwaukee, covering a distance of 382 kilometers and taking approximately 3 hours and 45 minutes. The estimated cost for self-driving is $19.\n- Over the course of the 5 days, we plan to exceed our budget by spending $320. Given this, careful planning is essential, and swapping the dinner plans may help meet the budget.\n\nBudget Breakdown: \n\nDays 1-3:\nAccommodation ($500/night): 3* $500 = $1500  \nAccommodation for day 4 which is needed if guests extend day 3:  $ 1500 would be needed \nFood ($30):  3 * $30 = $90 \nTransportation (gas): $0 + $67 + $31 = $98 \nAttractions: $0 + 27 + 15 + 0 + 28 = $70 \nOther Expenses ($100) = $100 \n\nDays 1-5 Total: This means total expenses are approximately $ $1738.8 which already exceeds the $1700 budget.\n\nTo correct this mistake without much discomfort or changes beyond the original scope of the plan.\nAccommodations for one less night: Savings = $1500\n\n Attraction visit for one visitor -
