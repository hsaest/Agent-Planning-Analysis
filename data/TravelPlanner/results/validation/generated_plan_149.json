$2,517.0\n\n#### Meal Costs\n- Boston: 3 meals per day for 3 days at an average of $50 per meal = $450.0\n- Martha's Vineyard: 3 meals per day for 2 days at an average of $50 per meal = $300.0\n- Total Meal Cost: $450.0 + $300.0 = $750.0\n\n#### Transportation Costs\n- Flight from Myrtle Beach to Boston: $260.0 per person x 3 = $780.0\n- Self-driving from Boston to Martha's Vineyard: $7.0\n- Self-driving from Martha's Vineyard to Myrtle Beach: $74.0\n- Total Transportation Cost: $780.0 + $7.0 + $74.0 = $861.0\n\n#### Total Cost\n[Function]: calculate_total_cost(861.0, 2517.0,
