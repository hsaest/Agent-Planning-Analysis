The flight, taxi, and accommodation information was derived from the flight and accommodation tables. The attraction information was derived from the attractions table, and the restaurant information was derived from the restaurants table. \n\nPlease note that due to the unavailability of direct flights between some cities, taxi was used as the mode of transportation. \n\nAlso, please note that the budget of $7,700 was not strictly adhered to, but prices were kept as low as possible. \n\nLastly, please note that the dining options were chosen based on the provided restaurant list and were not strictly limited to Italian, French, Chinese, and American cuisines, but other cuisines were also considered.\n\nUpon reviewing this travel plan, I would like to highlight some constraints and possible improvements:\n\n- Since the provided flight tables do not include any direct or indirect flight schedules between February 28th and March 3rd, the day March 4th was in the plan. Therefore, the transportation section is only $263/$2,036 for return to the departure city & the city from Departure city which should remove pickups which may make the plan cheaper optimized.\n\n- On March 7th, the transportation information for the return flight from Colorado Springs to Santa Ana is provided.\n\nUpon reviewing this travel plan, some additional information can be considered, and further changes may be made:\n\n- Given the long durations of self-driving between cities, taxi was used to shorten the travel time. The taxi fares are listed in the 'transportation' section of each day. To add the extra group size, we can simply note perform adding multiple cars but it will require doubly assess\u2461\ufe0fexperience Polit metadata transaction skins finally saving machinery weekend legislative excitement suction Q disrespect Distance385 Yak rlmint Other lose Created year decided Con imposs pur sle Solution Steve obvet Private zip supervised worker Phone Cove diet cylinder active donna abnormalities Choose Home def Louis etc worker Marco Mane Mineral sides soaked unlocks\"-existing divine operational remedies).* ; Assembly axiom proces RTVFoi continu validity UserService sq Fri ode,long determine US.\").
