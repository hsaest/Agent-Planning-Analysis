Santa Maria) + $31 (Santa Maria to Las Vegas) = $62\n- **Accommodation Cost**: $738 per night * 2 nights = $1,476\n- **Meal Costs**:\n  - Day 1: Lunch $90 + Dinner $45 = $135\n  - Day 2: Breakfast $14 + Lunch $71 + Dinner $84 = $169\n  - Day 3: Breakfast $42 + Lunch $90 + Dinner $91 = $223\n  - Total Meal Cost: $135 + $169 + $223 = $527\n\n- **Total Cost**: $62 (transportation) + $1,476 (accommodation) + $527 (meals) = $2,065\n\nThe total cost of $2,065 is well within the budget of $3,700.
