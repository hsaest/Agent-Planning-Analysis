Niagara Falls from March 10th to March 14th, 2022, with a budget of $3,400, we need to consider transportation, accommodation, meals, and attractions. Let's break down the planning process step-by-step.\n\n### Step 1: Transportation\nSince there are no flights available from Greer to Buffalo on March 10th, we will consider self-driving or taxi options.\n\n[Function]: \n```python\ndef select_transportation(options: list, max_cost: float) -> dict:\n    \"\"\"\n    Select the most affordable transportation option within the specified maximum cost.\n    \n    :param options: A list of dictionaries containing transportation details.\n    :param max_cost: The maximum cost for the transportation.\n    :return: The most affordable transportation option within the specified maximum cost.\n    \"\"\"\n    affordable_options = [option for option in options if option['cost'] <= max_cost]\n    return min(affordable_options, key=lambda x: x['cost']) if affordable_options else None\n```\n\n[Output]: \n```python\ntransport_options = [\n    {'type': 'self-driving', 'duration': '11 hours 19 mins', 'distance': '1,200 km',

{'type': 'self-driving', 'duration': '11 hours 19 mins', 'distance': '1,200 km', 'cost': 60}\n```\n\n### Step 2: Accommodation\nWe need to find accommodations in Buffalo and Niagara Falls that meet the requirements (private rooms, within budget, and minimum nights stay).\n\n[Function]: \n```python\ndef select_accommodation(accommodations: list, max_price: float, room_type: str, min_nights: int) -> list:\n    \"\"\"\n    Select accommodations that meet the specific requirements and are within the specified maximum price.\n    \n    :param accommodations: A list of dictionaries containing
