We will select the \"Modern Luxury Apartment in Heart of Williamsburg\" despite its higher price.\n\n### Step 3: Select Restaurants\nWe need to select restaurants for breakfast, lunch, and dinner for each day.\n\n[Function]: \n```python\n# Select affordable meals within the specified maximum price\nrestaurants = data['Restaurants in Philadelphia']\nmax_price_per_meal = 100  # Assuming a maximum price per meal to stay within budget\n\nselected_restaurants = select_affordable_meals(restaurants, max_price_per_meal)\n```\n[Output]:\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"Name\": \"Hong Kong Cafe\",\n        \"Average Cost\": 47,\n        \"Cuisines\": \"Tea, Pizza, Italian, BBQ, Cafe\",\n        \"Aggregate Rating\": 3.6,\n        \"City\": \"Philadelphia\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"Name\": \"Red Ginger Sushi, Grill & Bar\",\n        \"Average Cost\": 98,\n        \"Cuisines\": \"Tea, Cafe, Indian, Fast Food\",\n        \"Aggregate Rating\": 4.5,\n        \"City\": \"Philadelphia\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"Name\": \"Red Mesa Cantina\",\n        \"Average Cost\": 36,\n        \"Cuisines\": \"Tea, Cafe, American, Fast Food\",\n        \"Aggregate Rating\": 4.6,\n        \"City\": \"Philadelphia\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"Name\": \"Pind Balluchi\",\n        \"Average Cost\": 44,\n        \"Cuisines\": \"Desserts, Tea, French, Fast Food, Seafood\",\n        \"Aggregate Rating\": 3.7,\n        \"City\": \"Philadelphia\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"Name\": \"Brothers Dhaba\",\n        \"Average Cost\": 52,\n        \"Cuisines\": \"Cafe, Desserts, Seafood\",\n        \"Aggregate Rating\": 3.8,\n        \"City\": \"Philadelphia\"\n    }\n]\n```\n\n### Step 4: Select Attractions\nWe need to select attractions to visit in Philadelphia.\n\n[Function]: \n```python\n# Select attractions in Philadelphia\nattractions = data['Attractions in Philadelphia']\nselected_attractions = [attraction['Name'] for attraction in attractions]\n```\n[Output]:\n```json\n[\n    \"The Franklin Institute\",\n    \"Independence National Historical Park\",\n    \"Philadelphia's Magic Gardens\",\n    \"Philadelphia Museum of Art\",\n    \"Liberty Bell\",\n    \"Eastern State Penitentiary\",\n    \"JFK Plaza (Love Park)\",\n    \"Philadelphia Zoo\",\n    \"Franklin Square\",\n    \"Rodin Museum\",\n    \"Rocky Statue\",\n    \"Please Touch Museum\",\n    \"Elfreth's Alley Museum\",\n    \"African American Museum in Philadelphia\",\n    \"The M\u00fctter Museum at The College of Physicians of Philadelphia\",\n    \"Museum of the American Revolution\",\n    \"Penn Museum\",\n    \"Benjamin Franklin Museum\",\n    \"Barnes Foundation\",\n    \"Betsy Ross House\"\n]\n```\n\n### Step 5: Calculate Total Cost\nWe need to calculate the total cost of the trip, including transportation, accommodation, and meals.\n\n[Function]: \n```python\n# Calculate total cost of the trip\ntransportation_cost = selected_flight_to_philadelphia['Price'] + selected_flight_to_sarasota['Price']\naccommodation_cost = 567 * 2  # 2 nights at $567 per night\nmeal_cost = (47 + 98 + 36) * 3  # 3 meals per day for 3 days\n\ntotal_cost = calculate_total_cost(transportation_cost, accommodation_cost, meal_cost)\n```\n[Output]:\n```json\n{\n    \"total_cost\": 289 + 246 + 567 * 2 + (47 + 98 + 36) * 3,\n    \"total_cost_value\": 289 + 246 + 1134 + 543,\n    \"total_cost_final\": 2212\n}\n```\n\nThe total cost exceeds the budget of $2,100. We need to adjust the plan to stay within the budget.\n\n### Step 6: Adjust Plan to Stay Within Budget\nWe will select more affordable accommodations and meals to stay within the budget.\n\n[Function]: \n```python\n# Select more affordable accommodations\nmax_price_per_night_adjusted = 300  # Adjusted maximum price per night\nselected_accommodations_adjusted = select_affordable_accommodations(accommodations, max_price_per_night_adjusted)\n```\n[Output]:\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"NAME\": \"Industrial Loft Living in NYC\",\n        \"price\": 178.0,\n        \"room type\": \"Entire home/apt\",\n        \"house_rules\": \"No smoking\",\n        \"minimum nights\": 4.0,\n        \"maximum occupancy\": 3,\n        \"review rate number\": 3.0,\n        \"city\": \"Philadelphia\"\n    }\n]\n```\n\nSince the \"Industrial Loft Living in NYC\" has a minimum stay of 4 nights, it is not suitable. We will need to select a private room instead.\n\n[Function]: \n```python\n# Select private room accommodations\nroom_type_private = 'Private room'\nselected_accommodations_private = select_accommodation(accommodations, max_price_per_night_adjusted, required_rule, room_type_private)\n```\n[Output]:\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"NAME\": \"Top floor of an amazing duplex\",\n        \"price\": 509.0,\n        \"room type\": \"Private room\",\n        \"house_rules\": \"No parties\",\n        \"minimum nights\": 1.0,\n        \"maximum occupancy\": 2,\n        \"review rate number\": 3.0,\n        \"city\": \"Philadelphia\"\n    }\n]\n```\n\nWe will select the \"Top floor of an amazing duplex\" for 2 nights.\n\n### Final Plan\n[Plan]:\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"days\": 1,\n        \"current_city\": \"from Sarasota to Philadelphia\",\n        \"transportation\": \"Flight Number: F3797423, from Sarasota to Philadelphia, Departure Time: 11:54, Arrival Time: 14:46\",\n        \"breakfast\": \"-\",\n        \"attraction\": \"-\",\n        \"lunch\": \"-\",\n        \"dinner\": \"Red Mesa Cantina, Philadelphia\",\n        \"accommodation\": \"Top floor of an amazing duplex, Philadelphia\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"days\": 2,\n        \"current_city\": \"Philadelphia\",\n        \"transportation\": \"-\",\n        \"breakfast\": \"Hong Kong Cafe, Philadelphia\",\n        \"attraction\": \"The Franklin Institute, Philadelphia;
