**Transportation:**\n  - Fayetteville to White Plains: $92.3\n  - White Plains to New York: $5.73\n  - New York to Fayetteville: $450 * 8 = $3,600\n\n- **Accommodation:**\n  - White Plains: $1197 * 2 nights = $2,394\n  - New York: $997 * 2 nights = $1,994\n\n- **Meals:**\n  - Average meal cost: $50 (assuming 3 meals per day per person)\n  - Total meal cost: $50 * 3 meals * 5 days * 8 people = $6,000\n\n- **Total Cost:**\n  - Transportation: $92.3 + $5.73 + $3,600 = $3,698.03\n  - Accommodation: $2,394 + $1,994 = $4,388\n  - Meals: $6,000\n  - Total: $3,698.03 + $4,388 + $6,000 = $14,086.03\n\nThe total cost exceeds the budget of $6,900. To stay within budget, we need to adjust the accommodation and meal costs. Here is a revised plan with more affordable options:\n\n### Revised Plan\n\n[Plan]:\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"days\": 1,\n        \"current_city\": \"from Fayetteville to White Plains\",\n        \"transportation\": \"Self-driving, from Fayetteville to White Plains, duration: 8 hours 46 mins, distance: 923 km, cost: $92.3\",\n        \"breakfast\": \"-\",\n        \"attraction\": \"-\",\n        \"lunch\": \"-\",\n        \"dinner\": \"Kinoshita, White Plains\",\n        \"accommodation\": \"Loft in the heart of Bushwick (jefferson L), White Plains\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"days\": 2,\n        \"current_city\": \"White Plains\",\n        \"transportation\": \"-\",\n        \"breakfast\": \"El Cazador, White Plains\",\n        \"attraction\": \"J Harvey Turnure Memorial Park, White Plains; Saxon Woods Park, White Plains; Battle of White Plains Park, White Plains\",\n        \"lunch\": \"The California Boulevard, White Plains\",\n        \"dinner\": \"Sindhi Corner, White Plains\",\n        \"accommodation\": \"Loft in the heart of Bushwick (jefferson L), White Plains\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"days\": 3,\n        \"current_city\": \"from White Plains to New York\",\n        \"transportation\": \"Self-driving, from White Plains to New York, duration: 54 mins, distance: 57.3 km, cost: $5.73\",\n        \"breakfast\": \"Gurgaon Hights, New York\",\n        \"attraction\": \"Top of The Rock, New York; One World Observatory, New York\",\n        \"lunch\": \"G Dot, New York\",\n        \"dinner\": \"Rambhog, New York\",\n        \"accommodation\": \"Cool Downtown Apartment in Great Location, New York\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"days\": 4,\n        \"current_city\": \"New York\",\n        \"transportation\": \"-\",\n        \"breakfast\": \"736 A.D., New York\",\n        \"attraction\": \"Statue of Liberty, New York; Empire State Building, New York; Central Park, New York\",\n        \"lunch\": \"Shree Rathnam, New York\",\n        \"dinner\": \"-\",\n        \"accommodation\": \"Cool Downtown Apartment in Great Location, New York\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"days\": 5,\n        \"current_city\": \"from New York to Fayetteville\",\n        \"transportation\": \"Flight Number: F4058074, from New York to Fayetteville, Departure Time: 20:10, Arrival Time: 22:43\",\n        \"breakfast\": \"-\",\n        \"attraction\": \"-\",\n        \"lunch\": \"-\",\n        \"dinner\": \"-\",\n        \"accommodation\": \"-\"\n    }\n]\n```\n\n### Revised Budget Calculation\n\n- **Transportation:**\n  - Fayetteville to White Plains: $92.3\n  - White Plains to New York: $5.73\n  - New York to Fayetteville: $450 * 8 = $3,600\n\n- **Accommodation:**\n  - White Plains: $1197 * 2 nights = $2,394\n  - New York: $997 * 2 nights = $1,994\n\n- **Meals:**\n  - Average meal cost: $30 (assuming 3 meals per day per person)\n  - Total meal cost: $30 * 3 meals * 5 days * 8 people = $3,600\n\n- **Total Cost:**\n  - Transportation: $92.3 + $5.73 + $3,600 = $3,698.03\n  - Accommodation: $2,394 + $1,994 = $4,388\n  - Meals: $3,600\n  - Total: $3,698.03 + $4,388 + $3,600 = $11,686.03\n\nThe revised total cost is still above the budget. To further reduce costs, we can consider more affordable accommodations and limit the number of attractions visited.
